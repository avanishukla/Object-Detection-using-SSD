# Detecting Objects in Images and Videos using Single Shot MultiBox Detector

By Avani Shukla and Ojas Mehta


Dataset used for training is Pascal VOC 2007 Dataset. <br />
Tensorflow SSD model pretrained on the COCO dataset is used. The model is further trained to get the better result.

20 objects that can be detected using the trained model are :
* Person: person
* Animal: bird, cat, cow, dog, horse, sheep
* Vehicle: aeroplane, bicycle, boat, bus, car, motorbike, train
* Indoor: bottle, chair, dining table, potted plant, sofa, tv/monitor

Detailed information and code is in the notebook "object_detection_ssd.ipynb".

Dataset, model and test results can be found in following directory:
